    image: '/Images/Locomotive/electric.jpg',
    longDescription: 'The WAP-7 is a high-speed electric locomotive developed by Chittaranjan Locomotive Works. Introduced in the early 2000s, it is capable of hauling long, heavy express trains at speeds up to 140 km/h. Its advanced features include regenerative braking and microprocessor-based controls, making it a favorite for premium passenger services.',
    history: 'WAP-7 was developed to meet the need for high-speed, high-power electric locomotives. It is based on the WAG-9 freight design but optimized for passenger service.',
    service: 'WAP-7s haul premier trains like Rajdhani, Shatabdi, and Duronto Expresses, providing fast and efficient service across electrified routes.',
    preservation: 'As a modern class, WAP-7s are still in active service, but a few prototypes are displayed at railway exhibitions.',
