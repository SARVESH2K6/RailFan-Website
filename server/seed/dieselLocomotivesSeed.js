    "longDescription": "The WDM-1 (Wide gauge Diesel Mixed class 1) was the first generation of mainline diesel-electric locomotives introduced in Indian Railways in the late 1950s. Built by ALCo (USA), these 1,950 hp locomotives marked India's first large-scale transition from steam to diesel traction. Characterized by a boxy body, Co-Co wheel arrangement, and a noticeable roof-mounted dynamic brake fan housing, they were capable of mixed traffic duties including passenger and freight services. Despite their modest power by modern standards, they symbolized modernity in post-independence India.",
    "history": "Introduced in 1957-58 under the World Bank aid program, WDM-1 units were imported from ALCo, USA. Only around 100 units were built. These locomotives initiated Indian Railways' dieselization era. Their success led to further collaborations with ALCo and the eventual production of WDM-2. Although operationally limited by reliability and parts availability over time, they remained in service for nearly three decades.",
    "service": "WDM-1 units served primarily on the Eastern and Northern Railway zones, often used on prestigious mail and express services in their early years. They were later relegated to shunting and departmental duties before retirement.",
    "preservation": "At least one WDM-1 unit, numbered 17000, has been preserved at the National Rail Museum, New Delhi. It's a significant part of Indian diesel locomotive heritage.",

    "longDescription": "ZDM-5 was the most modern narrow-gauge diesel-electric locomotive introduced in India. It featured improved ergonomics, better cab visibility, and digital control systems. Designed for use on premium NG services and in hilly terrain, it represented the final phase before narrow-gauge routes began conversion to broad gauge.",

    "longDescription": "The NDM-5 is a diesel-hydraulic locomotive built specifically for the narrow gauge (2 ft or 610 mm) Matheran Hill Railway in Maharashtra, India. It replaced aging steam locomotives and was designed for tight curves, steep gradients, and lighter track infrastructure. The locomotive has a distinct look with a compact body and a single cab, optimized for hilly terrain operations.",
    "history": "NDM-5 locomotives were introduced in the 1980s by the Chittaranjan Locomotive Works (CLW) to modernize the operations of hill railways like the Matheran Light Railway. Built with a hydraulic transmission and smaller profile, these locomotives became essential for hauling short-distance passenger services on narrow gauge routes.",
    "service": "Primarily used on the Matheran Hill Railway, the NDM-5 handled passenger rakes along the scenic and winding hill route. Their low axle load and short wheelbase made them perfect for the sharp curves and inclines of the terrain.",
    "preservation": "Several NDM-5 units are still in operational or semi-operational condition and are used occasionally during special services on the Matheran line. Some units have been preserved in railway museums and workshops.",

    "longDescription": "The NDM-6 is a diesel-hydraulic locomotive built for the 2 ft narrow gauge Neral–Matheran hill railway. Designed to be more powerful and robust than its predecessor NDM-5, it features enhanced braking systems for mountain safety, and higher tractive effort for improved hauling capacity on steep gradients. Its rugged and simple design made it ideal for hill railway conditions.",
    "history": "Developed and introduced in the 1990s, the NDM-6 was part of Indian Railways’ effort to maintain viable hill railway operations as steam traction was phased out. It retained a compact structure with modernized hydraulic transmission suited for the sharp curves and 1 in 20 gradients on the Neral–Matheran route.",
    "service": "Used exclusively on the Neral–Matheran railway, the NDM-6 remains critical for daily train operations and hauling supplies to remote hill stations. It can pull both passenger and maintenance trains with ease through the challenging terrain.",
    "preservation": "NDM-6 is still in service and maintained actively by Central Railway’s Neral shed. Due to its essential role, there are no preserved static units yet.",
