    longDescription: 'The WDM-2 is the workhorse of Indian Railways, introduced in the early 1960s. Built under license from ALCO, it served both passenger and freight duties for decades. Its robust design and adaptability made it the most numerous mainline diesel locomotive in India. Many units are still operational or used for shunting.',
    history: 'The WDM-2 was introduced to replace aging steam locomotives and modernize Indian Railways. Built in Varanasi, it became the backbone of both passenger and freight services.',
    service: 'WDM-2s were used across India for a variety of services, from express passenger trains to heavy freight. Their versatility and reliability made them a favorite among railway staff.',
    preservation: 'Several WDM-2 units have been preserved in museums and are sometimes used for special events and heritage runs.',
